  edge quotes mid,
  edges={nodes={font=\scriptsize, fill=white, sloped, inner sep=1pt}}]
{
  1 ->["Das"] 2 ->["ist"] 3 ->["das"] 4 ->["Haus"]

\subsection{开始使用绘图系统}

%``Users'' of the graph drawing engine can invoke the graph
绘图引擎的用户通常仅需在绘图时加上参数就可以调用绘图算法（引擎）。
%drawing algorithms often by just adding a single option to their
%picture. Here is a typical example, where the |layered layout| option
下面是一个典型的例子——其中 |分层布局| 选项告诉了 \tikzname\ 它应使用
%tells \tikzname\ that the graph should be drawn (``should be layed
被称为“分层绘图”的算法（后文将会介绍）并“输出图像”(``should be layed out``)：。
%out'') using a so-called ``layered graph drawing algorithm'' (what
%these are will be explained later):
\begin{codeexample}[]
\tikz [>=spaced stealth']
  \graph [layered layout, components go right top aligned, nodes=draw, edges=rounded corners]
  {
    first root -> {1 -> {2, 3, 7} -> {4, 5}, 6 }, 4 -- 5;
    second root -> x -> {a -> {u,v}, b, c -> d -> {w,z} };
    third root -> child -> grandchild -> youngster -> third root;    
  };
\end{codeexample}
%Here is another example, where a different layout method is used
下面是另一个例子，它实现了另一种更适合绘制“树”的输出效果。
%that is more appropriate for trees:
\begin{codeexample}[]
\tikz [grow'=up, binary tree layout, nodes={circle,draw}]
  \node {1}
  child { node {2}
    child { node {3} }
    child { node {4}
      child { node {5} }
      child { node {6} }
    }
  }
  child { node {7}
    child { node {8}
      child[missing]
      child { node {9} }
    }
  };
\end{codeexample}
%A final example, this time using a ``spring electrical layout''
在这一小节的最后，是时候用“spring electrical layout”（无所谓是什么啦……）装个逼啦\^\_\^：
%(whatever that might be\dots):
\begin{codeexample}[]
\tikz [spring electrical layout, node distance=1.3cm,
       every edge/.style={
         decoration={coil, aspect=-.5, post length=1mm,
                     segment length=1mm, pre length=2mm},
         decorate, draw}]
{
  \foreach \i in {1,...,6}
    \node (node \i) [fill=blue!50, text=white, circle] {\i};
    
  \draw (node 1) edge (node 2)
        (node 2) edge (node 3)
                 edge (node 4)
        (node 3) edge (node 4)
                 edge (node 5)
                 edge (node 6);
}
\end{codeexample}
%In all of the example, the positions of the nodes have only been

比如在最后一个例子中，在没有 |spring electrical layout| 选项时，
%option |spring electrical layout|, all of the nodes would have been

这些（自定义的）绘图算法既可以使用 Lua 语言（这可比\TeX\ 语言编程\emph{简单多了}），

%used.
而对于更大规模的图则必须要用到C/C++代码。


\subsection{The Layers of the Graph Drawing System}

\label{section-gd-layers}

Even though the graph drawing system presented in the following
sections was developed as part of \pgfname, it can be used
independently of \pgfname\ and \tikzname: It was (re)designed so that
it can be used by arbitrary programs as long as they are able to run
Lua. To achieve this, the graph drawing system consists of three
layers:

\begin{enumerate}
\item At the ``bottom'' we have the \emph{algorithmic layer}. This
  layer, written in Lua, contains all graph drawing
  algorithms. Interestingly, options must also be declared on this
  layer, so an algorithm together with all options it uses can and
  must be specified entirely on this layer.
  If you intend to implement a new graph drawing algorithm, you will
  only be interested in the functionality of this layer.

  Algorithm ``communicate'' with the graph drawing system through
  a well-defined interface, encapsulated in the class
  |InterfaceToAlgorithms|.
\item At the ``top'' we have the \emph{display layer}. This layer is
  not actually part of the graph drawing system. Rather, it is a piece
  of software that ``displays'' graphs and \tikzname\ is just one
  example of such a software. Another example might be a graph
  editor that uses the graph drawing system to lay out the graph it
  displays. Yet another example might be a command line tool for
  drawing graphs described in a file. Finally, you may also wish to
  use the graph drawing system as a simple subroutine for rendering
  graphs produced in a larger program.

  Since the different possible instantiations of the display layer are
  quite heterogeneous, all display layers must communicate with the
  graph drawing system through a special interface, encapsulated in
  the class |InterfaceToDisplay|.

  The main job of this class is to provide a set of methods for
  specifying that a graph has certain nodes and edges and that certain
  options have been set for them. However, this interface also allows
  you to query all options that have been declared by algorithms,
  including their documentation. This
  way, an editor or a command line tool can display a list of all
  graph drawing algorithms and how they can be configured.
\item
  The algorithm layer and the display layer are ``bound together''
  through the \emph{binding layer}. Most of the bookkeeping concerning
  the to-be-drawn graphs is done by the graph drawing system
  independently of which algorithm is used and also independently of
  which display layer is used, but some things are still specific to
  each display layer. For instance, some algorithms may create new
  nodes and the algorithms may then need to know how large these nodes
  will be. For this, the display layer must be ``queried'' during a
  run of the algorithm -- and it is the job of the binding layer to
  achieve this callback.
  
  As a rule, the binding layer implements the ``backward''
  communication from the graph drawing system back to the display
  layer, while the display layer's interface class provides only
  functions that are called from the display layer but which will not
  ``talk back''.
\end{enumerate}

All of the files concerned with graph drawing reside in the
|graphdrawing| subdirectory of |generic/pgf|. 

\subsection{Organisation of the Graph Drawing Documentation}

The documentation of the graph drawing engine is structured as
follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Following this overview section, the next section documents
  the graph drawing engine from ``the \tikzname\ user's point of
  view''. No knowledge of Lua or algorithmic graph drawing is needed
  for this section, everyone who intends to use algorithmic graph
  drawing in \tikzname\ may be interested in reading it.
\item You will normally only use \tikzname's keys and
  commands in order to use the graph drawing system, but, internally,
  these keys call more basic \pgfname\ commands that do the ``hard
  work'' of binding the world of \TeX\ boxes and macros to the
  object-oriented world of Lua. Section~\ref{section-gd-pgf} explains
  how this works and which commands are available for authors of
  packages that directly need to use the graph drawing system inside
  \pgfname, avoiding the overhead incurred by \tikzname.

  Most readers can safely skip this section.
\item The next sections detail which graph drawing algorithms are
  currently implemented as part of the \tikzname\ distribution, see
  Sections~\ref{section-first-graphdrawing-library-in-manual}
  to~\ref{section-last-graphdrawing-library-in-manual}.
\item
  Section~\ref{section-gd-algorithm-layer} is addressed at readers
  who wish to implement their own graph drawing
  algorithms. For this, \emph{no knowledge at all} of \TeX\
  programming is needed. The section explains the graph model used in
  Lua, the available libraries, the graph drawing pipeline, and everything
  else that is part of the Lua side of the engine.
\item
  Section~\ref{section-gd-display-layer} details the
  display layer of the graph drawing system.  You should read this 
  section if you wish to implement a new display system (that is, a
  non-\TeX-based program) that intends to use the graph drawing system.
\item
  Section~\ref{section-gd-binding-layer} explains how binding layers
  can be implemented. This section, too, is of interest only to
  readers who wish to write new display systems. 
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Acknowledgements}

Graph drawing in \tikzname\ began as a student's project under my
supervision. Ren\'ee Ahrens, Olof-Joachim Frahm, Jens
Kluttig, Matthias Schulz, and Stephan Schuster wrote the first
prototype of a graph drawing system inside \tikzname\ that uses
Lua\TeX\ for the implementation of graph drawing algorithms.

This first, early version was greatly extended on the algorithmic side
by Jannis Pohlmann who wrote his Diploma thesis on graph drawing under
my supervision. He implemented, in particular, the Sugiyama method
(|layered layout|) and force based algorithms. Also, he rewrote some
of the code of the prototype.

At some point it became apparent that the first implementation had a
number of deficiencies, both concerning the structure, the interfaces,
and (in particular) the performance. Because of this, I rewrote 
the code of the graph drawing system, both on the \TeX\ side
and on the Lua side in its current form. However, I would like to
stress that without the work of the people mentioned above graph
drawing in \tikzname\ would not exist.

The documentation was written almost entirely by myself, though I did
copy some paragraphs from Jannis's Diploma thesis, which I can highly
recommend everyone to read. 

In the future, I hope that other people will contribute algorithms,
which will be available as libraries.
